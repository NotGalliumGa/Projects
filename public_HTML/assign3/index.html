        <h1> My Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
            The invention of the first video game created a long and lengthy timeline of events that led us to todays modern age <br>
            of games and entertainment. It is quite interesting. Like many other big achievements made by humanity I believe videogames <br>
            should be one of them. 
        </p>
        <h2> An Example</h2>
        <p>
            Of course I believe this because of how videogames allowed us to find a way to invoke emotions in others aswell as connect <br>
            with them or yourself. An example could be <strong>Minecraft</strong>, a swedish video game about creativity where alone you can find out <br>
            your own mind's creativity while with friends you can work together to make the most wonderful things.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Significance</em></h3>
        <p>
            Much like many other significant events like the invention of the wheel or french revolution, video games led to great <br>
            strides and changes in many peoples lifes. Some people even having there living being made of the video games by either <br>
            playing them or making them. <br><br>
