                Explanation
            </h2>

            <p>
                The CBP(Communion of Bits and Pieces) project is a project that I believe to be a great idea. This may not be one that
                I can achieve through my current classes, however it seems to be a project right in my grasp. Something not to big as to 
                be my senior project, but not to small to be something I can just push aside.

            <h2>
                General Idea
            </h2>

            <p>
                The general idea of CBP is to essentially create a application much like facebook, instagram, and other social media apps.
                This app would be used to work with my close friends so that we can chat whenever and where ever. The reason it's so enticing is
                because I would be able to fully control said app and its uses. I could make fun minigames, schedule fun meetups, or just have casual
                chats with some of my buds.
            </p>
