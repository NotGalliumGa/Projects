        <p>
            My work experience started in Walmart where I worked for a year until I landed a spot at the Bank of New Hampshire as
            a Bank Service Representative.
        </p>
        <p>
            For educational endeavors, I attended and graduated Laconia High School with a GPA of 3.65 and was apart of the NHS and NTHS.
            I also attend 2 years of DMA to help my professionalism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have done several volenteering ventures detailed on the resume as well as others closer to home but not as big.
