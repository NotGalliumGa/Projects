                <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    The invention of the first video game created a<strong>long</strong>and lengthy timeline of events that led us to todays modern age 
                    of games and entertainment. It is<strong>quite</strong>interesting. Like many other big achievements made by humanity, I believe videogames
                    should be one of them. Of course I believe this because of how videogames allowed us to find a way to invoke emotions in others aswell as connect 
                    with them or yourself. An example could be<strong>Minecraft</strong>, a swedish video game about creativity where alone you can find out <br>
                    your own mind's creativity while with friends you can work together to make the most wonderful things. Much like many other significant events like the invention of the<strong>wheel</strong>or<strong>french revolution</strong>, video games led to great 
                    strides and changes in many peoples lifes. Some people even having there living being made of the video games by either 
                    playing them or making them.

                <h2>A Clash of Opinions</h2>
                <p>
                    My thoughts on this matter may be skewed in front of a greater whole like lets say,<strong>society</strong>. There are many differering opinions
                    than my own. Some may think that the invention of Videogames was a<strong>curse</strong>, or maybe that Videogames 
                    have<strong>no significance</strong>besides being fun to play. Many most likely don't believe in what I have to say on this website at all.
                    <em>But opinions are like buttholes, everyone has one.</em>So detailed on this site through the links above are my 
                    thoughts and opinions. Feel free to explore!
