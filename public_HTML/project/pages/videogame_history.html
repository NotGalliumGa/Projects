                <h2>The Start</h2>
                <p>
                    To keep things sweet and short, the developement of videogames was originally started by computer scientists working
                    on simple projects. One of the first ever video games being Space War, released in 1962 on redumentary equipment compared
                    to now. Eventually as the idea of video games was passed around, some heavy hitters were released. Those being Pong and
                    Computer Space. Starting what seems like a rat race for more fun and detailed games.

                <p>
                    Eventually with the invention of better processors came real time 3D polygonal graphic rendering, opening the
                    Videogame scene to endless posibilities. This is where we start to some of the big companies like Sega, Nintendo,
                    and Playstation start to pump out even better games on their new consoles. Those being the playstation, Nintendo64,
                    and Sega Master System. These consoles slowly but surely start to skew our percieved reality with fantasy.
