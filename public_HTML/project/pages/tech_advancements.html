                <p>
                    With the further inventions of new technology like:
                    3d rendering, VR, better processors, hyper graphics, and OLED
                    The Gaming experience has never been better before. The immersion into the virtual world has made itself
                    look more and more like our real world every day.

                <h3>The Good That It Has Done For Us</h3>
                <p>
                    With these new technologies, video games are no longer just for the casual user.
                    They can be found assisting police in training, helping scientist study animal behavior, or even help racecar drivers
                    get better with racing. This could mean many things, but what seems to be the most likely outcome is more experience
                    coming in the form of safe alternatives.
