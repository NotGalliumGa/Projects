                <p>
                    I can see a future where games are very helpful to our people. Where it has cause many major developements
                    and enabled us to become better at everything we've done. To give us experience with things we might not have
                    ever thought possible. I belive there are many good outcomes that can come from developing videogames. Ofcourse It is
                    ok to take everything I say with a grain of salt, but I truly do believe that we are sitting on something monumental. May
                    This one day be pushed forward into reality.

                    Who knows what great inventions lay await for us in the future. Perhaps finally we can rest our
                    eyes upon a hologram or maybe full dive VR. It's really up to anyones guess. I would like to hear about what 
                    you may have to say about our future in videogames or even just your thoughts about them. Please submit those
                    thoughts at this<a href="/project/pages/sources_and_info.html">link</a>in the form!
